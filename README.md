# Deep-Q-Network-using-Tensorflow
This repository contains Deep Q-Networks implementation in tensorflow for Open AI Gym environments such as Cartpole problem
and the mountain car problems. Its a plug and play code with no preprocessing required and just the main code has to be run.
Different hyperparamters can be changed as per the user.

The Deep Q-Networks algorithm implemented in the code is a direct implementation of the paper " Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" 
by Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Alex Graves, Ioannis Antonoglou, Daan Wierstra, Martin Riedmiller.
